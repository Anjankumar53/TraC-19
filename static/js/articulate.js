    document.getElementById("article_data").innerHTML="If you develop any of the below symptoms, do NOT panic. It is advisable to isolate yourself from other family members and get yourself checked for COVID-19, after consulting your doctor.<br>Newer symptoms of the second wave of COVID-19 infection, that you must be aware of include:  <br>1. Gastrointestinal tract infections: Your GI tract comprises the main organs of digestion, including the mouth, food pipe, stomach/gut, small and large intestine. Any disturbances in your GI system can wear down your immunity and hamper overall health. Symptoms of GI tract infections associated with COVID-19 include loss of hunger, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loose stools.<br> 2. Hearing loss: Hearing loss is one of the symptoms in the second wave of COVID-19 infection. It may range from mild, moderate to severe which results in a sudden hearing loss, impaired hearing, or ringing sound in your ears (tinnitus). This starts early in the first week of infection and resolves over a period of time.<br>3. Extreme lethargy and weakness: Extreme weakness and lethargy have been reported as one of the early symptoms of the COVID-19 infection, more so during the second wave. <br>Once your body identifies the COVID-19 virus as an invader, it initiates the immune response to fight the virus, and this can result in the infected person feeling tired and weak.<br>4. Pink eye or conjunctivitis: Pink eye is an infection of the eye which results in the swelling of the outer transparent membrane (called the conjunctiva) of your eyelid and eyeball.<br>Common symptoms include itching, redness, and tearing of the eyes, which results in puffy or watery eyes.<br>5. Dry mouth or not enough saliva: Dry mouth is now a common and initial symptom of COVID-19. Since the oral cavity (mouth) is a potential entry point for the novel coronavirus, it can attack the tissues and mucus lining your oral cavity, resulting in decreased saliva production and thus, dry mouth. <br>Like the dry mouth, other oral manifestations of the coronavirus infection could be a dry tongue, changes in the colour and texture of your tongue, sores or blisters, and difficulty in eating.<br>6. Diarrhoea: Diarrhoea or loose watery stools is one of the widespread symptoms seen in COVID-19 patients during the second wave. Reports suggest most individuals affected with COVID-19 complained of persistent diarrhoea for 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of 5 days. Since diarrhoea is not usually thought to be a symptom of COVID-19 and can be a result of other digestive issues, there is a delay in getting tested for COVID-19 and hence, a delay in the identification of potential COVID-19 positive patients.<br>7. Headache: Sudden headaches can be a symptom of COVID-19. A normal headache that continues for a long time and does not subside with painkillers, is being reported as one of the newer symptoms seen during the second COVID-19 wave. <br>8. Skin rashes: Recent studies have highlighted skin rashes as a new symptom of COVID-19. Patients have reported rashes on their hands and feet, which are usually called acral rashes. Studies suggest that these rashes can develop as a result of the immunological response to the virus. <br>9. Unexplained fatigue<br>Many people who tested positive for COVID-19 have reported feeling tired and fatigued prior to developing any other symptoms. In fact, in some cases, people don't have any other symptoms other than feeling fatigue and tired.  <br>Additionally, if you have difficulty in breathing, tightness in the chest or chest pain, pale or blue-coloured skin, a sudden loss of speech or movement, or new confusion, seek medical care immediately."
